The program is used to speed up calculations were guess and check is required.

You are free to use this app.

Instructions:

3) Constraints -> Choose whether you wish to maximize or minimize the value you are trying to solve for.

To exit midway, just close the Excel Application.
The optimal values will be set automatically.

Bugs:
The program has a few minor bugs still. You may not even notice them. I am working on multiple projects and will address the bugs as soon as I have time.
